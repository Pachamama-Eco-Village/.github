Welcome to the PachaMama Community organization! PachaMama serves as a platform for a deep voyage into healing, self-acceptance, and expansion of consciousness.

## About PachaMama

PachaMama is an intentional and alternative eco-village where individuals lead their lives in harmony with nature. The community fosters a safe space for each fellow traveler to shed old layers, transcend limitations, and discover wholeness.

## Six Pillars

### Meditation: Silence & Satsang

Silence is the Heartbeat of the PachaMama community life. Through daily Silent Sittings, Silent Retreats, and Satsangs, a precious opportunity is given to meet with the truth within and surrender to the beauty of the present moment.

### Emotional Healing: Therapy Groups

The Emotional Healing Groups focus on delving into the depths of one's being, cleaning out old emotions, and addressing suppressed feelings. By healing the wounds of the past, individuals can embrace a more fulfilling life in the present moment.

### Physical Rejuvenation: Yoga and Body Cleanse

PachaMama emphasizes physical rejuvenation through yoga practices and Body Cleanse programs. These programs provide guidelines for a healthy lifestyle, detoxify the body, and cleanse the colon and liver. Additionally, the community offers daily yoga classes and a month-long Yoga Teacher Training.

### Red Road: Ancestral Wisdom

The Red Road embodies the unity of all beings and honors the ancient customs of the Indigenous ancestors of the Americas. Through sacred songs, dances, and ceremonies, PachaMama brings everyone together as part of a universal family.

### Ecology: Eco Village

PachaMama's commitment to ecology is evident in the concept of an interconnected web of relationships, where all living organisms and elements rely on each other. By maintaining biodiversity and balance, the community cultivates a healthy, sustainable, and self-replicating ecosystem.

### Musical Journeys: Spread your Wings

Gathering as a family to pray, heal, and sing on the wings of musical masterpieces, each journey is a unique opportunity to experience the medicine of divine vibration within the embrace of a loving community.
